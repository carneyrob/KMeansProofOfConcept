# KMeansProofOfConcept

This is a simple proof of concept for k-means clustering implemented in Python. Though numerous effective libraries exist for k-means,this was built from the ground up (though I do use Numpy to speed up matrix operations). Ultimately, I would like to use this to build an image compression k-means algorithm.
